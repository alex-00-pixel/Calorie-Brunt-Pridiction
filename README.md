## Predictive Modeling of Calories Burned using XG Boost Regression
In the fast-paced environment of modern life, characterized by hectic schedules and demanding work commitments, individuals often struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Neglecting dietary habits and insufficient physical activity contribute to the rising issue of obesity. Recognizing the importance of staying fit, many people turn to diets and exercise, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of calories consumed and burned.
While tracking consumed calories is relatively straightforward with information available on product labels and the internet, estimating calories burned poses a challenge due to the limited availability of accurate measurement devices. This study addresses this gap by employing a machine learning (ML) algorithm, specifically the XG Boost Regression model, to predict calories burned.

## Introduction
Online payment fraud poses a significant threat in today's digital landscape. This project aims to develop an effective fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. Three primary classification algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, have been implemented to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the system.


## Methods
In addition to the initial algorithms, the XGBoost algorithm has been incorporated to improve the model's predictive capabilities further.

## Results
Explore the Jupyter Notebooks within the project for comprehensive details on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks provide insights into each classification algorithm's performance, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
